while watching this piece of crap the day after i saw a min trailer that one minute included all all what was at least not boring to watch so don t waste money or time on this one get the original it s much better though the effects might not be up to date 

although it has been years i still remember the complete waste that comprises the entire plot of the movie unfortunately i came across this movie after my friends and i selected it while browsing through the new releases at blockbuster we decided to pick the movie because it was the only one we all had not seen and it sounded like it may be enjoyable although it has been quite some time since i viewed the movie i still remember the lack of plot seriously there is no true plot and complete waste of time that was spent watching the movie if you are in the video store and this film catches your eye walk on and find a better movie if you did end up seeing this movie i understand your pain 

it is a piece of crap not funny at all during the whole movie nothing ever happens i almost fell asleep which in my case happens only if a movie is rally bad that is why it didn t get awful out of but don t be fooled like i was by first review a waste of money and your time spend it on other stuff at this point i m finished with my review but i have to fill in at least ten lines of text so i will go on ctrl c ctrl v it is a piece of crap not funny at all during the whole movie nothing ever happens i almost fell asleep which in my case happens only if a movie is rally bad that is why it didn t get awful out of but don t be fooled like i was by first review a waste of money and your time spend it on other stuff it is a piece of crap not funny at all during the whole movie nothing ever happens i almost fell asleep which in my case happens only if a movie is rally bad that is why it didn t get awful out of but don t be fooled like i was by first review a waste of money and your time spend it on other stuff

dd films were damn corny damn stupid and had a plot which seemed wafer thin but those days they was a plot at least this film isn t just a comedy but a mix of melodrama romance everything every drama scene is blown out of proportion the comedy is funny but corny too yet the film keeps you entertained those days govinda films were loud crass yet they had some funny moments people enjoyed david dhawan does a okay job music is okay govinda acts well in comedy and drama karisma is decent in parts and annoys in parts kader is as usual gulshan prem chopra are typecast shakti is hilarious

while it does crack the odd good joke the humour is generally quite dry with members of the panel frequently pulling faces or resorting to coarse language and waiting on the crowd to applaud lame enough jokes unlike what an other comment says i don t think this is the best rte have ever made its really dry and sarcastic sarcasm is the lowest form of wit there are few truly funny intelligent gags that would make you genuinely laugh out loud people seem to be convinced by the comedians well known names rather than by judging the quality of the gags which aren t really that good overall its mediocre with some good laughs to be had but often it can be fairly mediocre its not as good as jasper carrot or dave allens stuff i find benny hill funnier 

this movie is just funny mindless but funny to enjoy this movie completely you can t have a perception of how a film like this goes and just enjoy all the side jokes and puns which are involved with the film i still find the bit at the start funny when he says want a beer cock funny stuff but what makes the film decent is the fact that it doesn t try to hard to create a serious spin on the film too many comedies try to have serious aspects which you just don t believe but this is different and just focuses on being funny i must say though yasmin bleeth is terrible in the film and adds nothing but the main guys coop remer and squeak are very funny to watch and make the film great to watch

what a fun filled sexy movie they certainly don t make them like this anymore sexy au pairs arrive in london and have all sorts of sexual misadventures the tone is oddly innocent as the considerable nudity evolves out of stock farcical situations rather than any overt sexual desire on the part of the characters it is only when the actresses accidentally lose their clothes that the male characters become rampant richard o sullivan literally gets randi sic the film certainly betrays the origins of the softcore feature as lying in the nudie cuties and naturism films of the old school my special interest in au pair girls is that i am a huge fan of gabrielle drake if any actress has ever looked better naked she s slim but wonderfully curvy or clothed come to that i ve loved her since the original run of ufo who else could carry off a purple wig i ll eat my hat 

this is a lot of silliness about a woman from london who marries a tea planter from ceylon whom she barely knows it s full of cliches and the liz taylor character is not believable it has a marvelous set some exotic location footage it shows taylor at the height of her beauty she looks stunning 

much like the early horror film the boogens the devious unseen killer is quite a letdown when it finally becomes seen although animal house s stephen furst obviously had fun in the role as a product of incest his performance is more comedy than horror the plot an extremely tired one has three sexy women bach lamm and lois young unable to find a hotel for the evening so they willingly accept to stay with a seemingly kind museum curator exceptionally played by the deceased sydney lassick if you have ever seen any horror film you know that lovable il sydney is a deranged psycho so one knows what will happen to the lovely ladies the three women are all very attractive especially barbara bach but lois young a helen hunt clone is the only one to go nude as sydney watches her take a bath
